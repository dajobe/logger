    <h1>IRC Chat Logger</h1>

    <p>An IRC logging 'bot in Perl that can record IRC sessions on
    multiple channels in RDF, text and HTML.  That's pretty much all
    it does although there is a little support for searching and
    keeping note of action items for meetings.</p>


    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>It requires the Net::IRC perl module which you can get from 
    <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.  Once that is installed
    you can just run the bot with its two required arguments:</p>
    <pre>
  perl logger PASSWORD irc://SERVER/CHANNEL
    </pre>
    <p>where PASSWORD is some phrase for controlling the bot,
    SERVER is the IRC server name and CHANNEL is the channel
    (leave out the leading '#' if there is one).
    </p>


    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>The documention is built into the source.  Either ask the
    bot for help on IRC with <tt><em>nickname</em>: help</tt> or
    view the POD documentation in the source via the perldoc program:</p>

    <pre>
  perldoc logger
    </pre>

    <p>You can also read an HTML version of the documentation
    in <a href="help.html">help.html</a>.
    </p>
